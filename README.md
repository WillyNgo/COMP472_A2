To demo this project, you can run each algortihm individually by running the following files:
- uniform_search.py
- greedy_search.py
- a_star_search.py

Each of the files will run the algorithm for the 3 puzzles given by the prof, followed by the 50 puzzles we created.

In GBFS and A*'s case, it will also run those for the two heuristics we created (h1 and h2)
